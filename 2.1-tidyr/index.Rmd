# Using `tidyr`, `dplyr`

- Writing readable code using **pipes**
- What is **tidy data**? Why do you want tidy data? Getting your data into tidy form using tidyr.
- Reading different **data formats**
- String operations, working with **text**

---
# The pipe operator `%>%`

- `x %>% f(y)` is the same as `f(x, y)`
- part of `dplyr` package
- pipes allow the code to be *read* like a sequence of operations

Example:

```{r}
tb <- read_csv(here::here("data/TB_notifications_2019-07-01.csv"))
tb %>% filter(year == 2016) %>% group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(cases = sum(c_newinc, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% arrange(desc(cases))
```

---
# What is **tidy data**? 

- What do we expect tidy data to look like?
- Couple of exercises to look closer at what we find in practice

# Your turn 1

What are the variables?

```{r echo=FALSE}
grad <- read_csv("../data/graduate-programs.csv")
head(grad[c(2,3,4,6)])
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
in the columns, subject, Inst, AvNumPubs, ...
```

# Your turn 2

What's in the column names of this data? What are the experimental units? What are the measured variables?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
genes <- read_csv("../data/genes.csv")
head(genes)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
the experimental design is coded into the variable names, genotype:WI/WM, time:6/12, rep:1/2/4
```

---

# Your turn 3

What are the variables? What are the records?

```{r echo=FALSE}
melbtemp <- read.fwf("../data/ASN00086282.dly", 
   c(11, 4, 2, 4, rep(c(5, 1, 1, 1), 31)), fill=T)
head(melbtemp[,c(1,2,3,4,seq(5,100,4))])
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
variables are TMAX, TMIN, PRCP, year, month, day, stationid. Each row contains the values for one month!
```

# Your turn 6

10 week sensory experiment, 12 individuals assessed taste of french fries on several scales (how potato-y, buttery, grassy, rancid, paint-y do they taste?), fried in one of 3 different oils, replicated twice. First few rows:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
load(here::here("data/french_fries.rda"))
head(french_fries, 4)
```

What is the experimental unit? What are the factors of the experiment? What was measured? What do you want to know?

# Messy Data Patterns

There are various features of messy data that one can observe in practice. Here are some of the more commonly observed patterns:

- Column headers are values, not variable names
- Variables are stored in both rows and columns, contingency table format
- One type of experimental unit stored in multiple tables
- Dates in many different formats

---
# What is Tidy Data?

- Each observation forms a row
- Each variable forms a column
- Data is contained in a single table
- Long form makes it easier to reshape in many different ways
- Wider forms are common for analysis

# Tidy Verbs

- `gather`: specify the **keys** (identifiers) and the **values** (measures) to make long form (used to be called melting)
- `spread`: variables in columns (used to be called casting)
- `separate`/`unite`: split and combine columns
- `nest`/`unnest`: working with list variables

---
# Gathering
  
`gather(data, key = "key", value = "value", ...)`

`data %>% gather(key = "key", value = "value", ...)`

- `gather` turns a wide format into a long format
- two new variables are introduced (in key-value format): **key** and **value**: multiple columns (specified in `...`) are collapsed; their names go into variable `key`, their values go into variable `value`.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dframe <- data.frame(id = 1:2, trtA=c(2.5,4.6), trtB = c(45, 35))
```

```{r}
dframe
dframe %>% gather(treatment, outcome, trtA, trtB)
```

---
# TB notifications
  
new notifications of TB have the form `new_sp_genderage`:
  
```{r}
read_csv(here::here("data/TB_notifications_2019-07-01.csv")) %>% 
  select(country, iso3, year, starts_with("new_sp_")) %>%
  head()
```





---
# TB notifications (gather)
  
create two new variables: variable `key` (contains all variable names starting with `new_sp_`) and variable `count` with the values:
  
```{r}
tb1 <- read_csv(here::here("data/TB_notifications_2019-07-01.csv")) %>% 
  select(country, iso3, year, starts_with("new_sp_")) %>%
  gather(key, count, starts_with("new_sp_")) 
tb1 %>% na.omit() %>% head()
```

---
# Separate Columns
  
`separate (data, col, into, sep = "[^[:alnum:]]+", ...)`
`data %>% separate (col, into, sep = "[^[:alnum:]]+", ...)`



- split column `col` from data frame `frame` into a set of columns as specified in `into`
- `sep` is the splitting separator. By default splits happen for any non-alphanumeric value. <br>
Pro tip: specify `sep` to have some more control; any regular expression will work
- `unite` combines multiple variables into one

---
# TB notification (separate)
  
Work on `key`: 
  
```{r}
tb2 <- tb1 %>% 
  separate(key, sep = "_", into=c("foo_new", "foo_sp", "genderage")) 
tb2 %>% na.omit() %>% head()
```


---
# TB notification (separate again)
  
Now split `genderage` into first character (m/f) and rest.
`substr` allows to extract sub strings from a character vector (see `?substr`):
  
```{r}
tb3 <- tb2 %>% select(-starts_with("foo")) %>%
  mutate(gender=substr(genderage, 1, 1), 
         age=substr(genderage, 2, length(genderage))) %>%
  select(-genderage)
tb3 %>% na.omit() %>% head()
```

# Your turn



Turn the `french_fries` data (from package `reshape`) from wide format into a long format with variables `type` and `rating`. 
What would we like to find out about this data?
  
```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(french_fries)
```



---
# What Would We Like to Know?
  
- Is the design complete?
- Are replicates like each other?
- How do the ratings on the different scales differ?
- Are raters giving different scores on average?
- Do ratings change over the weeks?
  
Each of these questions involves different summaries of the data.

---
# Gathering the French Fries
  
```{r}
ff_long <- gather(french_fries, key = type, value = 
                    rating, potato:painty)
head(ff_long)
```

---
# Long to Wide
  
In certain applications, we may wish to take a long dataset and convert it to a wide dataset (perhaps displaying in a table).

This is called "spreading" the data.

---
# Spread
  
We use the **spread** function from `tidyr` to do this:
  
```{r}
french_fries_weeks <- spread(ff_long, key = time, 
                             value = rating)

head(french_fries_weeks)
```

Plot Week 1 against Week 9 in a scatterplot:
```{r, eval =FALSE}
french_fries_weeks %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `1`, y = `9`)) + geom_point()
```

---
# Week 1 vs week 9


```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height = 5}
french_fries_weeks %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `1`, y = `9`)) + geom_point()
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn


## Do the Replicates Look Like Each Other?

Tackle this by plotting the replicates against each other using a scatterplot. 

You will need to first gather the data into long form, and then get the replicates spread into separate columns by replicate. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ff.s <- ff_long %>% spread(key=rep, value=rating)
ggplot(data=ff.s, aes(x=`1`, y=`2`)) + geom_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1) 
ggplot(data=ff.s, aes(x=`1`, y=`2`)) + geom_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1) + 
  xlab("Rep 1") + ylab("Rep 2") + facet_wrap(~type, ncol=5)
```



---
# Are ratings similar on different scales?
  
- Are ratings similar on the different scales: potato'y, buttery, grassy, rancid and painty?
- We need to gather the data into long form, and make plots facetted by the scale. 

---
# Ratings on the Different Scales

```{r}
ff.m <- french_fries %>% 
gather(type, rating, -subject, -time, -treatment, -rep)
head(ff.m)
```

--

```{r, fig.height=2, fig.width=8}
ggplot(data=ff.m, aes(x=rating)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=2) + 
facet_wrap(~type, ncol=5) 
```

---
# Side-By-Side Boxplots

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
ggplot(data=ff.m, aes(x=type, y=rating, fill=type)) + 
geom_boxplot()
```

---
# Ratings by week

How do ratings change over the weeks?
Again, we use the long form of the data and plot:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
ff.m$time <- as.numeric(ff.m$time)
ggplot(data=ff.m, aes(x=time, y=rating, colour=type)) + 
geom_point(size=.75) +
geom_smooth() +
facet_wrap(~type)
```


---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn

Read the genes data from folder `data`. Column names contain data and are kind of messy. Introduce data frame `gtidy` as shown below:

```{r}
genes <- read_csv("../data/genes.csv")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
gtidy <- genes %>%
gather(variable, expr, -id) %>%
separate(variable, c("trt", "leftover"), "-") %>%
separate(leftover, c("time", "rep"), "\\.") %>%
mutate(trt = sub("W", "", trt)) %>%
mutate(rep = sub("R", "", rep))
```

```{r}
head(gtidy)
```


---
# Plot from before

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height = 5}
gmean <- gtidy %>% 
  group_by(id, trt, time) %>% 
  summarise(expr = mean(expr))
gtidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = trt, y = expr, colour=time)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(data = gmean, aes(group = time)) +
  facet_wrap(~id)
```

---
# Models and model output

Functions such as `lm`, `glm`, `lmer`, ... allow us to fit models

e.g. fit french fry rating with respect to all designed main effects:

```{r}
ff_long <- gather(french_fries, key = type, value = 
rating, potato:painty)
ff_lm <- lm(rating~type+treatment+time+subject, 
data=ff_long)
```

---

`summary`, `str`, `resid`, `fitted`, `coef`, ... allow us to extract different parts of a model for a linear model. Other model functions work differently ... major headaches!

```{r}
summary(ff_lm)
```



---
# Tidying model output

The package `broom` gets model results into a tidy format at different levels

One value for each:

- model: `broom::glance`
- coefficient in the model: `broom::tidy`
- value in the dataset: `broom::augment`



---
# Goodness of fit statistics: `glance`

```{r}
glance(ff_lm)
```

---
# Model estimates: `tidy`

```{r}
ff_lm_tidy <- tidy(ff_lm)
glimpse(ff_lm_tidy)
```

---
# Model diagnostics: `augment`

```{r}
ff_lm_all <- augment(ff_lm)
glimpse(ff_lm_all)
```

---
# Residual plot

```{r}
ggplot(ff_lm_all, aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid)) + geom_point()
```

---
# Adding random effects

Add random intercepts for each subject

```{r results='hide'}
library(lme4)
fries_lmer <- lmer(rating~type+treatment+time+subject + ( 1 | subject ), 
data = ff_long)
```


---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn

- Augment the ff_long data with the model diagnostics
- Plot the residuals from the (a) fixed, (b) random effects
- Plot fitted values against observed values

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

## the model is pretty bad:
ff_lmer_all <- augment(fries_lmer)

ggplot(ff_lmer_all, aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid)) + geom_point() +
  coord_equal()

ggplot(ff_lmer_all, aes(x=.fitted, y=rating)) + geom_point() +
  coord_equal()

```
