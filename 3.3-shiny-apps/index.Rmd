# Example: App to explore PISA data

- Apps need to be in their own directory
- Navigate to the pisa_world directory and double-click the `pisa_world.Rproj` to open the code for the app.
- Open the file `app.R` in the text editor. 
- There is a change on the RStudio menu, you should now see a button labelled `Run App`. Clicking on this will run it. Try it!

---
# Structure 

The structure of the app is very simple. It has a menu of a statistic to show on the map. Let's take a look at how it is constructed. 

- There are 90 lines of code.
- There are two functions: `ui()`, `server()`
    - `ui()`: sets up the menu and the canvas to draw on
    - `server()`: does the computations 
- Global code at the top of the file reads and processes the data, loads libraries, and sets up lists for the menu.

---
# User Interface

- `fluidPage` allows the size of components to be driven by the size of the browser window
- `titlePanel` puts a header on the page
- `sidebarLayout` sets up the container for the user interface
    - `sidebarPanel` puts in the side panel: `selectInput` defines the menu input, asking for the variable, we call `y` to be used to colour the map `Colour by` is the label shown to the user, and the menu items are in the `realvars` vector. 
    - `mainPanel` makes the drawing canvas: `plotOutput` specifies we want to make a plot in this panel, and the code instructions to use are called `map`. You need to look in the server function to find the code in `output$map`
        
---
# Server

- The function `output$map` contains code to create the plot, based on the user input.
- `renderPlot` indicates the output is a plot
- The code is the same as the plotting code see thus far, *except for* `aes_string`. We used `aes` before to specify variable mapping, but need to use `aes_string` because the name of variables are passed in as strings/text as read from the `selectInput` menu.

# Create your first app

- On the RStudio, `File` menu, `New file`, `Shiny web app` to start a new app
- The easiest start is the `One file`, which will put both server and ui functions in the same file, `app.R`

---
# Shiny Inputs

Shiny has many different input options:

- `actionButton()` - creates a clickable button
- `checkboxInput()` and `checkboxGroupInput()`
- `dateInput()` - calendar to select a date
- `dateRangeInput()` - select a range of dates
- `fileInput()` - upload a file
- `numericInput()` - input a numeric value
- `radioButtons()` - select one or more items
- `sliderInput()` - slide along a range of values
- `textInput()` - input a string

---
# Shiny Outputs

Shiny also has many output options:

- `renderDataTable()` - outputs an interactive, sortable data table
- `htmlOutput()` - output html elements
- `renderPlot()` - output an R plot
- `renderPrint()` - output text from print() in R
- `renderTable()` - output an HTML table
- `renderText()` - output text from R
- `renderUI()` - output a custom part of the user interface
- `renderImage()` - print an image to the page

---
# Other User Interface Options

- `tabsetPanel()` - make multiple different output views (i.e. a plot in one tab, a data table in another)
- `helpText()` - create additional text to help users navigate your applet
- `submitButton()` - only update outputs when this button is clicked
- `conditionalPanel()` - only show certain UI options when conditions are met (i.e. if a certain tab is open, or a certain input is selected)

# Your turn

- Add an interactive plot of the TB data into your app.
- Include a menu, so that the user can choose a country to display. 

---
# Deploy an app

- Sign up for an account on [https://www.shinyapps.io/](https://www.shinyapps.io/)
- Authenticate your account
- You may need to do some setup in your session, e.g. install the library `rsconnect`
