# What is a data plot?

- data
- **aesthetics: mapping of variables to graphical elements**
- geom: type of plot structure to use
- transformations: log scale, ...
- layers: multiple geoms, multiple data sets, annotation
- facets: show subsets in different plots
- themes: modifying style

# Why?

With the grammar, a data plot becomes a statistic. It is a functional mapping from variable to graphical element. Then we can do statistics on data plots. 

With a grammar, we don't have individual animals in the zoo, we have the genetic code that says how one plot is related to another plot.

---
# Elements of the grammar

```
ggplot(data = <DATA>) +

     position = <POSITION>
  ) +

The 7 key elements of the grammar are:

- DATA

# Example: Tuberculosis data

This is current tuberculosis data taken from [WHO](http://www.who.int/tb/country/data/download/en/), the case notifications table. There's also an R package, [TBinR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/getTBinR/index.html), that can be used to dynamically download this data.

```{r read TB data and wrangle and subset to USA}
tb <- read_csv(here::here("data/TB_notifications_2019-07-01.csv")) %>% 
  select(country, iso3, year, new_sp_m04:new_sp_fu) %>%
  gather(stuff, count, new_sp_m04:new_sp_fu) %>%
  separate(stuff, c("stuff1", "stuff2", "sexage")) %>%
  select(-stuff1, -stuff2) %>%
  mutate(sex=substr(sexage, 1, 1), 
         age=substr(sexage, 2, length(sexage))) %>%
  select(-sexage)

# Filter years between 1997 and 2012 due to missings
tb_us <- tb %>% 
  filter(country == "United States of America") %>%
  filter(!(age %in% c("04", "014", "514", "u"))) %>%
  filter(year > 1996, year < 2013)
```

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.width=10, fig.height=3}
ggplot(tb_us, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_grid(~ age) 
```

`r set.seed(20190709); emo::ji("fantasy")` `r set.seed(20190712); emo::ji("fantasy")` `r set.seed(20190711); emo::ji("fantasy")` **TWO MINUTE CHALLENGE**

- What do you learn about tuberculosis incidence in the USA from this plot?
- Give three changes to the plot that would improve it. 


```{r eval=FALSE}
- Incidence is declining, in all age groups, except possibly 15-24
- Much higher incidence for over 65s
- There appears to be a structural change around 2008. Either a recording change or a policy change?
- Missing information for 1998
- 
- Cannot compare counts for male/female using stacked bars, maybe fill to 100% to focus on proportion
- Colour scheme is not color blind proof, switch to colorbrewer Dark2 palette
- Axis labels, and tick marks?
```

---
# Fix the plot

```{r colour and axes fixes, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3}
# This uses a color blind proof scale
ggplot(tb_us, aes(x=year, y=count, fill=sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  facet_wrap(~age, ncol=6) +
  scale_fill_brewer("", palette="Dark2") 
```

---
# Compare males and females

```{r compare proportions of males/females, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3}
# Fill the bars, note the small change to the code
ggplot(tb_us, aes(x=year, y=count, fill=sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="fill") + 
  facet_wrap(~age, ncol=6) +
  scale_fill_brewer("", palette="Dark2") + ylab("proportion")
```

`r set.seed(20190709); emo::ji("fantasy")` `r set.seed(20190712); emo::ji("fantasy")` `r set.seed(20190711); emo::ji("fantasy")` **TWO MINUTE CHALLENGE**

- What do we learn about the data that is different from the previous plot?
- What is easier, what is harder or impossible to learn from this arrangement?

```{r eval=FALSE}
- Focus is now on proportions of male and female each year, within age group
- Proportions are similar across year 
- Roughly equal proportions at young and old age groups, more male incidence in middle years
```

---
# Separate plots

```{r side-by-side bars of males/females, fig.height=3, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# This code does something strange to the axis tick marks
# We will skip it for now
#ggplot(tb_us, aes(x=year, y=count, fill=sex)) +
#  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge") + 
#  facet_wrap(~age, ncol=6) +
#  scale_fill_brewer("", palette="Dark2") +
#  scale_x_continuous("year", breaks=seq(1995, 2012, 5), labels=c("95", "00", "05", "10"))
```

```{r compare counts of males/females, echo=TRUE, fig.height=4}
# Make separate plots for males and females, focus on counts by category
ggplot(tb_us, aes(x=year, y=count, fill=sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  facet_wrap(sex~age, ncol=6) +
  scale_fill_brewer("", palette="Dark2") 
```

`r set.seed(20190709); emo::ji("fantasy")` `r set.seed(20190712); emo::ji("fantasy")` `r set.seed(20190711); emo::ji("fantasy")` **TWO MINUTE CHALLENGE**

- What do we learn about the data that is different from the previous plot?
- What is easier, what is harder or impossible to learn from this arrangement?

```{r eval=FALSE}
- Counts are generally higher for males than females 
- There are very few female cases in the middle years
- Perhaps something of a older male outbreak in 2007-8, and possibly a young female outbreak in the same years
```

---
# Make a pie

```{r rose plot of males/females, echo=TRUE, fig.height=5}
# How to make a pie instead of a barchart - not straight forward
ggplot(tb_us, aes(x=year, y=count, fill=sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  facet_wrap(sex~age, ncol=6) +
  scale_fill_brewer("", palette="Dark2") +
  coord_polar()
```

Not a pie, a [rose plot](https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/nightingale_rose_chart.html)!

---
# Stacked bar

```{r stacked barchart of males/females, echo=TRUE, fig.height=5}
# Step 1 to make the pie
ggplot(tb_us, aes(x = 1, y = count, fill = factor(year))) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="fill") + 
  facet_wrap(sex~age, ncol=6) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d("", option="inferno") 
```

---
# Pie chart

```{r pie chart of males/females, echo=TRUE, fig.height=5}
# Now we have a pie, note the mapping of variables
# and the modification to the coord_polar
ggplot(tb_us, aes(x = 1, y = count, fill = factor(year))) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="fill") + 
  facet_wrap(sex~age, ncol=6) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d("", option="inferno") +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") 
```

---

`r set.seed(20190709); emo::ji("fantasy")` `r set.seed(20190712); emo::ji("fantasy")` `r set.seed(20190711); emo::ji("fantasy")` **TWO MINUTE CHALLENGE**

- What are the pros, and cons, of using the pie chart for this data?
- Would it be better if the pies used age for the segments, and facetted by year (and sex)?

---
# Line plot vs barchart

```{r use a line plot instead of bar, fig.height=3}
ggplot(tb_us, aes(x=year, y=count, colour=sex)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~age, ncol=6) +
  scale_colour_brewer("", palette="Dark2") 
```

A line plot allows reading the counts for the two sexes. The counts are displayed in the same plot, and males and females can be directly compared as well as temporal trend.  

---
# Line plot vs barchart

```{r use a line plot of proportions, fig.height=3}
tb_us %>% group_by(year, age) %>% 
  summarise(p = count[sex=="m"]/sum(count)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=p)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.50, colour="white", size=2) +
  geom_line() + geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~age, ncol=6) +
  ylab("proportion of males") 
```

Computing proportion and displaying only this, forces the attention to be on the one quantity. Proportion here is computed separately for year and age, which means we are directly comparing the counts within these subsets. 

Adding the guideline to indicate equal proportions is an important baseline.

# Your turn

- Facet by gender, and make line plots of counts of age. 
- Show the points only, and overlay a linear model fit.

# Example 2: Platypus in Australia

Where can you find the strange platypus in Australia?

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Platypus-sketch.jpg" width="80%" />

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Platypus-sketch.jpg

---

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Data extracted from ALA with this code
# install.packages("ALA4R")
library(ALA4R)
l <- specieslist("platypus")
platypus <- occurrences("Ornithorhynchus anatinus", download_reason_id=10)
save(platypus, file="data/platypus.rda")
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
load(here::here("data/platypus.rda"))
platydata <- platypus$data
ggplot(data=platydata) + geom_point(aes(x=longitude, y=latitude))
```

---

Add some transparency to see density of locations.

```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data=platydata) + geom_point(aes(x=longitude, y=latitude), alpha=0.1)
```

---

If you are good at recognising the shape of Australia, you might realise that the sightings are all along the east coast and Tasmania. There is a strange location, that looks like someone saw one in Antarctica! We might need to filter this observation out later, because its extremely unlikely to have been found that far south.

But, we can make it look a bit more like Australia by making a map projection, using `coord_map`.

---


```{r  echo=TRUE, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data=platydata) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=longitude, y=latitude), alpha=0.1) +
  coord_map()
```


The locations would be even more recognisable if we added a real map underneath. One way this can be done is to use a google map. The `ggmap` package has an interface to extracting google maps. Install it and then grab a map of Australia with this code.

---

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(ggmap)
register_google(XXX)
oz <- get_map(location=c(lon=133.8807, lat=-23.6980), zoom=4)
save(oz, file="data/oz.rda")
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
load(here::here("data/oz.rda"))
ggmap(oz) + 
  geom_point(data=platydata, aes(x=longitude, y=latitude), 
              alpha=0.1, colour="orange")
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn

Change the dotplot into a density plot, to focus on the locations of frequent sightings.

Do you learn anything different than from the scatterplot?

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggmap(oz) + 
  geom_density2d(data=platydata, aes(x=longitude, y=latitude), 
              colour="orange") 
```

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
Not a lot different. It shows perhaps high density regions around Melbourne, Brisbane and south of Sydney. These match high population sites, though, and maybe reiterates the sampling being convenience sampling. We miss the smaller areas of sightings, like northern Queensland.
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn

Platypus are mostly found on the east coast of the country, but there is a population close to Adelaide in south Australia. Why is this?

---
# Temporal trend

The date of the sighting is another variable in the data set. Let's make a plot of the sightings over time. The variable is called `eventDate`. It is considered to be a `character` variable by R, so the first step is to get R to recognise that it is a date time object.

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(lubridate)
platydata <- platydata %>% 
  mutate(eventDate = ymd(eventDate))
```

---

then we can simply plot occurrence over time.

```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data=platydata) +
  geom_point(aes(x=eventDate, y=1))
```

---

There are some records dating back before 1800. There were only records from 1770! And these first records are in the database!

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Check odd cases
platydata %>% filter(latitude < (-50)) 
# These just have the lat/long wrong
platydata %>% filter(eventDate < ymd("1850-01-01")) 
```

---

Let's focus on records since 1900, and count the number for each year.

```{r echo=TRUE}
platydata1900 <- platydata %>% filter(year>1900) %>%
  count(year) 
ggplot(data=platydata1900) +
  geom_point(aes(x=year, y=n))
```

---

Add a trend line.

```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data=platydata1900, aes(x=year, y=n)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se=F)
```

---
Make it interactive so that we can investigate some observations.

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(plotly)
ggplotly()
```

# Your turn

*Discussion question:* Was there a population explosion in 1980 and 2004? Is the population of platypus increasing since 1900, and decreasing in the last decade?


---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn

- Subset the data to 1950-2010
- Create a new variable for decade
- Make a map separately for each decade - the `facet_wrap` function can help here.

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
platydata_50_10 <- platydata %>% filter(year>1949, year<2010) %>%
  mutate(decade = cut(year, breaks=seq(1950, 2019, 10),
   include.lowest=TRUE, 
   labels=c("50-59", "60-69", "70-79", "80-89", "90-99", "00-09")))
ggmap(oz) + geom_point(data=platydata_50_10, mapping=aes(x=longitude, y=latitude), colour="orange", alpha=0.1) +
  facet_wrap(~decade)
```

# Your turn

- Focusing again on TB, choose a different country to examine, for example, Australia. 
- Create a similar sequence of plots for your chosen country's data, and feel free to experiment with new types.
- Write a data story describing what you have learned about TB in your chosen country based on a selection of your favorite plots, by putting the code and explanations into an Rmarkdown document, and compile to html.
- Feel free to share with your instructors.
