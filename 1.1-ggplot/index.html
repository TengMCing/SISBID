# Your turn: What is a data plot?

Write down as many types of data plots that you can. You've got 30 seconds.

# What is a data plot?

- data
- **aesthetics: mapping of variables to graphical elements**
- geom: type of plot structure to use
- transformations: log scale, ...
- layers: multiple geoms, multiple data sets, annotation
- facets: show subsets in different plots
- themes: modifying style

---
# Why?

With the grammar, a data plot becomes a statistic. It is a functional mapping from variable to graphical element. Then we can do statistics on data plots. 

With a grammar, we don't have individual animals in the zoo, we have the genetic code that says how one plot is related to another plot.

---
# Elements of the grammar

```
ggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;) + 
  &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;(
     mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;),
     stat = &lt;STAT&gt;, 
     position = &lt;POSITION&gt;
  ) +
  &lt;COORDINATE_FUNCTION&gt; +
  &lt;FACET_FUNCTION&gt;
```

The 7 key elements of the grammar are:

- DATA
- GEOM_FUNCTION
- MAPPINGS
- STAT
- POSITION
- COORDINATE_FUNCTION
- FACET_FUNCTION

# Example: Tuberculosis data

This is current tuberculosis data taken from [WHO](http://www.who.int/tb/country/data/download/en/), the case notifications table.




```r
ggplot(tb_us, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "fill") +
  facet_grid(~ age) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

100% charts, is what excel names these beasts. What do we learn?

- Focus is on **proportion** in each category. 
- Across all ages, and years, the proportion of males having TB is higher than females
- These proportions tend to be higher in the middle age groups, for all years.
- Relatively similar proportions across years.

---
# Bar charts


```r
ggplot(tb_us, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_grid(~ age) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

What do we learn?

- Focus is on **counts** in each category. 
- Different across ages, and years, counts tend to be lower in young age (15-24)
- Incidence has been decreasing although among younger age groups it is only in recent years.


---
# Side-by-side barcharts


```r
ggplot(tb_us, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position="dodge") +
  facet_grid(~ age) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

What do we learn?

- Focus is on counts by gender, predominantly male incidence.
- There is similar incidence between males and females in younger age groups.
- Decline is less prominent among middle age females.

---
#  Separate bar charts


```r
ggplot(tb_us, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_grid(gender ~ age) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

What do we learn?

- Its easier to focus separately on males and females.

---
# Pie charts?


```r
ggplot(tb_us, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_grid(gender ~ age) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2") + 
  coord_polar() +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank())
```

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

Nope! That's a rose chart. Bar charts in polar coordinates produce rose charts. 

What do we learn?

- Emphasizes the difference between men and women, and really small numbers for middle aged females. 

---
# Rainbow charts?


```r
ggplot(tb_us, aes(x = 1, y = count, fill = factor(year))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position="fill") +
  facet_grid(gender ~ age) 
```

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

A single stacked bar, in each facet. Year is mapped to colour. 

What do we learn?

- Pretty chart but not easy to interpret. 

---
# Pie charts


```r
ggplot(tb_us, aes(x = 1, y = count, fill = factor(year))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position="fill") +
  facet_grid(gender ~ age) +
  coord_polar(theta="y") +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank())
```

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

What do we learn?

- Pretty chart but not easy to interpret, or make comparisons across age groups.

# Your turn

- Choose a different country to examine relative to tuberculosis incidence, for example, Australia. 
- Make a R Markdown notebook, for your analysis
- Create the same sequence of plots as done in slides 7-20 for your chosen country's data
- Write a paragraph describing what you have learned about tb in your chosen country from each plot.

# Perceptual principles

- Hierarchy of mappings: (first) position along an axis - (last) color (Cleveland, 1984; Heer and Bostock, 2009)
- Pre-attentive: Some elements are noticed before you even realise it.
- Color: (pre-attentive) palettes - qualitative, sequential, diverging.
- Proximity: Place elements for primary comparison close together. 
- Change blindness: When focus is interrupted differences may not be noticed.

---
# Hierarchy of mappings

- 1.Position - common scale (BEST)
- 2.Position - nonaligned scale
- 3.Length, direction, angle
- 4.Area
- 5.Volume, curvature
- 6.Shading, color (WORST)
