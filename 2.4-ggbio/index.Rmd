# GGenealogy

- Genealogy is the study of parent-child relationships.
- Comparative geneticists, computational biologists, and bioinformaticians commonly use genealogical tools to better understand the histories of novel traits arising across biological lineages, e.g. modifications in crops could include an increase in protein yield.
- R packages: `ggenealogy`, `pedigree`, `kinship2`

---
# Package comparison

- `pedigree`: standardized chart used to study human family lines (Coster, 2013)
- `kinship2`: basic pedigree charts (Therneau, Daniel, Sinnwell, Atkinson, 2015)
- `ggenealogy`: focused on agronomic genealogical lineages (Rutter, Vanderplas, Cook, Graham 2016)

---
# Soybeans

```{r}
data("sbGeneal")
str(sbGeneal)
```

---
# Input format

- data frame structure with at least two columns
- One column must be labeled "child", and be `character`
- other column must be labeled "parent"" and each case in that column must either be of type character, or a missing denoted by NA, or "".
- additional information can be useful, e.g. `year`, `yield`

---
# Conversion to graph structure

Needed for most other functions

```{r}
ig <- dfToIG(sbGeneal)
ig
```

---
# Basic statistics

```{r}
getBasicStatistics(ig)
```

---
# Functions

- shortest path
- plotting ancestors and descendants
- plotting distance matrix
- using interaction

---
# Shortest path

```{r fig.show='hide'}
pathTN <- getPath("Brim", "Bedford", ig, sbGeneal, "devYear")
pathTN
plotPath(pathTN, sbGeneal, "devYear")
```

---

```{r echo=FALSE}
plotPath(pathTN, sbGeneal, "devYear")
```

---

We can plot the path on the entire network, but it is messy

```{r}
sb <- sbGeneal[complete.cases(sbGeneal[1:3]),]
ig <- dfToIG(sb)
pathCL <- getPath("Clark", "Lawrence", ig, sb, "yield")
plotPathOnAll(pathCL, sb, ig, "yield", "devYear") + 
  ggplot2::xlab("Yield") + ggplot2::ylab("Year")
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn

- Read the Statistics genealogy data (`statGeneal`)
- Plot the shortest path between `Irène Gijbels` and `Gerda Claeskens`
- BONUS: Who are these statisticians? What do they work on?

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
data(statGeneal)
stat <- statGeneal[complete.cases(statGeneal[1:3]),]
statIG <- dfToIG(statGeneal)
pathG <- getPath("Irène Gijbels", "Gerda Claeskens", 
                 statIG, stat, "gradYear")
plotPath(pathG, statIG, "gradYear")
plotPathOnAll(pathG, statGeneal, statIG, 
              "gradYear")
```


---
# Plotting ancestors and descendants

This allows focusing on individuals, and examine where they came from and what was produced. 

```{r}
plotAncDes("Lee", sbGeneal, mAnc = 6, mDes = 6, vCol = "blue")
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn

How many repeated lines can you see in the descendants?

---
# Repeats

- Some varieties are repeated in the plot, to alleviate ambiguities in the soybean breeding knowledge
- e.g., the variety 5601T is represented four times - once as a third generation descendant of Lee, once as a fourth generation descendant of Lee, and twice as a fifth generation descendant of Lee.
- Because, there are multiple paths between Lee and 5601T

---

![](repeats.png)

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn

- For the statistics genealogy find the ancestors and descendants of `Irène Gijbels`

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
plotAncDes("Irène Gijbels", statGeneal, mAnc = 3, mDes = 3, vCol = "blue")
```

---
# Another fun example

Have a look at Hadley's academic family tree:
```{r}
hw <- read_csv("../data/hw-gen.csv")
names(hw)[2:3] <- c("parent", "child")
plotAncDes("Hadley Alexander Wickham", hw, mAnc=6, mDes=1)
```

---
# You are not in `statGeneal`?

You can use the `mathGen` package (github repo: `heike/mathGen`) to scrape the MathGenealogy project (remember to scrape responsibly!).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# devtools::install_github("heike/mathGen")
library(mathGen) 
hw <- ancestry(id = 145799, steps = 4) # look up ID from MathGenealogy
hw <- plyr::rbind.fill(data.frame(advisorMGID=145799, advisorName="Hadley Alexander Wickham"), hw)
names(hw)[2:3] <- c("parent", "child")
hw$parent <- as.character(hw$parent)
```
```{r}
head(hw)
```

---
# Plotting distance matrix

a.k.a the `Kevin Bacon distance`

```{r fig.show='hide'}
varieties <- c("Brim", "Bedford", "Calland", "Dillon", "Hood", "Narow",
  "Pella", "Tokyo", "Young", "Zane")
p <- plotDegMatrix(varieties, ig, sbGeneal)
p + ggplot2::scale_fill_continuous(low = "white", high = "darkgreen")
```

---
#

```{r echo=FALSE}
p <- plotDegMatrix(varieties, ig, sbGeneal)
p + ggplot2::scale_fill_continuous(low = "white", high = "darkgreen")
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn

Plot the distance matrix for these statisticians: `Thomas Lumley`, `Rob Hyndman`, `Grace Wahba`, `Gordon Smyth`, `Elizaveta Levina`, `David Cox`, `Irène Gijbels`, `Gerda Claeskens`

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
statisticians <- c("Thomas Lumley", "Rob Hyndman", "Grace Wahba", "Gordon Smyth", "Elizaveta Levina", "David Cox", "Irène Gijbels", "Gerda Claeskens")
p <- plotDegMatrix(statisticians, statIG, statGeneal) 
p + ggplot2::scale_fill_continuous(low = "white", high = "darkgreen") 
```

---
# Interaction

- When paths are plotted on the entire network most of the information gets lost. 
- This can be alleviated by making the plot interactive, so that node labels appear on mouse over.
- This is facilitated with the package `plotly`.
- Demo

```{r eval=FALSE}
plotPathOnAll(pathTN, sbGeneal, sbIG, "devYear",
              pathEdgeCol = "seagreen2", nodeSize = 1, 
              pathNodeSize = 3,
   animate = TRUE)
```
