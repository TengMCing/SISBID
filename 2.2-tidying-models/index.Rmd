# Your turn



Turn the `french_fries` data from wide format into a long format with variables `type` and `rating`. 
  
```{r your turn to work on the french fries data, echo=FALSE}
head(french_fries)
```

What would we like to find out about this data?



---
# What would we like to know?
  
- Is the design complete?
- Are replicates like each other?
- How do the ratings on the different scales differ?
- Are raters giving different scores on average?
- Do ratings change over the weeks?
  
Each of these questions involves different summaries of the data.

---
# Gathering the french fries
  
```{r put french fries in long form}
ff_long <- gather(french_fries, key = type, value = 
                    rating, potato:painty)
head(ff_long)
```

---
# Long to wide
  
In certain applications, we may wish to take a long dataset and convert it to a wide dataset (perhaps displaying in a table).

This is called "spreading" the data.

---
# Spread
  
We use the **spread** function from `tidyr` to do this:
  
```{r spread it back into wide form}
french_fries_weeks <- spread(ff_long, key = time, 
                             value = rating)

head(french_fries_weeks)
```

Plot Week 1 against Week 9 in a scatterplot:

```{r check the wide form data, eval =FALSE}
french_fries_weeks %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `1`, y = `9`)) + geom_point()
```

---
# Week 1 vs week 9


```{r week 1 vs week 9, fig.width=5, fig.height = 5}
french_fries_weeks %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `1`, y = `9`)) + geom_point()
```

---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn: Do the replicates look like each other?

Tackle this by plotting the replicates against each other using a scatterplot. 

You will need to first gather the data into long form, and then get the replicates spread into separate columns by replicate. 


```{r solution to do the replicates look like each other, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ff.s <- ff_long %>% spread(key=rep, value=rating)
ggplot(data=ff.s, aes(x=`1`, y=`2`)) + geom_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1) 
ggplot(data=ff.s, aes(x=`1`, y=`2`)) + geom_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1) + 
  xlab("Rep 1") + ylab("Rep 2") + facet_wrap(~type, ncol=5)
```



---
# Are ratings similar on different scales?
  
- Are ratings similar on the different scales: potato'y, buttery, grassy, rancid and painty?
- We need to gather the data into long form, and make plots facetted by the scale. 

---
# Ratings on the different scales

```{r ratings on the different scales}
ff.m <- french_fries %>% 
gather(type, rating, -subject, -time, -treatment, -rep)
head(ff.m)
```

--

```{r, fig.height=2, fig.width=8}
ggplot(data=ff.m, aes(x=rating)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=2) + 
facet_wrap(~type, ncol=5) 
```

---
# Side-by-side boxplots

```{r side-by-Side boxplots, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
ggplot(data=ff.m, aes(x=type, y=rating, fill=type)) + 
geom_boxplot()
```

---
# Ratings by week

How do ratings change over the weeks?
Again, we use the long form of the data and plot:

```{r ratings by week, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
ff.m$time <- as.numeric(ff.m$time)
ggplot(data=ff.m, aes(x=time, y=rating, colour=type)) + 
geom_point(size=.75) +
geom_smooth() +
facet_wrap(~type)
```

---
# Models and model output

Functions such as `lm`, `glm`, `lmer`, ... allow us to fit models

e.g. fit french fry rating with respect to all designed main effects:

```{r models and model output}
ff_long <- gather(french_fries, key = type, value = 
rating, potato:painty)
ff_lm <- lm(rating~type+treatment+time+subject, 
data=ff_long)
```

---

`summary`, `str`, `resid`, `fitted`, `coef`, ... allow us to extract different parts of a model for a linear model. Other model functions work differently ... major headaches!

```{r examine the model fit}
summary(ff_lm)
```



---
# Tidying model output

The package `broom` gets model results into a tidy format at different levels

One value for each:

- model: `broom::glance`
- coefficient in the model: `broom::tidy`
- value in the dataset: `broom::augment`



---
# Goodness of fit statistics: `glance`

```{r goodness of fit statistics}
glance(ff_lm)
```

---
# Model estimates: `tidy`

```{r model estimates}
ff_lm_tidy <- tidy(ff_lm)
glimpse(ff_lm_tidy)
```

---
# Model diagnostics: `augment`

```{r model diagnostics}
ff_lm_all <- augment(ff_lm)
glimpse(ff_lm_all)
```

---
# Residual plot

```{r residual plot}
ggplot(ff_lm_all, aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid)) + geom_point()
```

---
# Adding random effects

Add random intercepts for each subject

```{r add random intercepts for each subject, results='hide'}
library(lme4)
fries_lmer <- lmer(rating~type+treatment+time+subject + ( 1 | subject ), 
data = ff_long)
```


---
class: inverse middle 
# Your turn

- Augment the ff_long data with the model diagnostics
- Plot the residuals from the (a) fixed, (b) random effects
- Plot fitted values against observed values

```{r solution to french fries modeling, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

## the model is pretty bad:
ff_lmer_all <- augment(fries_lmer)

ggplot(ff_lmer_all, aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid)) + geom_point() +
  coord_equal()

ggplot(ff_lmer_all, aes(x=.fitted, y=rating)) + geom_point() +
  coord_equal()

```
