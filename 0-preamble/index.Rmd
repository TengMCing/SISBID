# Your turn: meet your neighbors!

Take a couple of minutes to introduce yourself to the people around you. Ask them some questions about where they come from, why they chose to do the workshop, what sort of data they usually work with, whether they have used R before, ....

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(2018)
## if package emo doesn't exist, 
## uncomment the lines below and install from github:
# library(devtools)
# install_github("hadley/emo")
library(emo)
ji("smile") ; ji("highfive") ; ji("spock"); ji("computer")
```

# What is R Markdown?

- __Get started with RMarkdown__, by creating a new R notebook. Knit it. 
- Now __open the file that created these slides__ `0-preamble/index.Rmd`. Navigate to the code chunks at the bottom of the file and run them. You should be able to run these one chunk at a time. If you want to compile the entire document, you will need to install several new packages.

# Installing packages
