# Tours of high-dimensions


Most of what you find when you google "visualising high-dimensions" is awful, e.g. use colour and symbol after 3D to show 5D; PCA, MDS, tSNE, are visualisation methods; "you can't see beyond 3D".... Rubbish!

**What are dimensions?**

<img src="cubes.png" style="width: 90%; align: center" />

- When you add another variable, you implicitly add another orthogonal axis. 
- The space is effectively a $p$-dimensional cube
- The data might not fill the cube, and then dimension reduction might make it a $k(<p)$-dimensional cube

*Without thinking too much*: How many clusters do you see?

```{r code for generating a 6D tour, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# The tour requires making many plots, and updating.
# The RStudio graphics device doesn't work well
# Open a graphics window

# What is a tour?

.pull-left[
A grand tour is by definition a movie of low-dimensional projections constructed in such a way that it comes arbitrarily close to showing all possible low-dimensional projections; in other words, a grand tour is a space-filling curve in the manifold of low-dimensional projections of high-dimensional data spaces.

Here is a grand tour of a 3D classic data set

<iframe src="images/flea3d.html" width="800" height="500" scrolling="yes" seamless="seamless" frameBorder="0"> </iframe>

The axes show the combination of variables making up any particular 2D projection.

This is a grand tour of the full 6D. Can you see clusters? Corresponding to the colours?

These two animations were made with `plotly`.

# Why use a tour?

Other than basic exploration:

- **initial data analysis**: to examine whether the data 
    - satisfies assumptions required for the method
    - has unexpected complications like outliers or nonlinearity
- **examine the model fit**:    
    - dimension reduction, e.g. to look at more than 2 PCs
    - clustering, and examine the model like the dendrogram in high-d, or the k-means, or the estimated model from model-based
    - classification: boundaries between classes, misclassifications, diagnostics like vote matrix from random forest

---
# Guided tour

The guided tour chooses new target projections by optimising a function of interest:

$$\mathop{\text{maximize}}_{\phi_{11},\dots,\phi_{p1}} f\left(\sum_{j=1}^p \phi_{j1}x_{ij}\right) \text{ subject to }
\sum_{j=1}^p \phi^2_{j1} = 1$$

- `holes`: This is an inverse Gaussian filter, which is optimised wheren there is not much data in the center of the projection, i.e. a "hole" or donut shape in 2D.
- `central mass`: The opposite of holes, high density in the centre of the projection, and often "outliers" on the edges. 
- `LDA`: An index based on the linear discrimination dimension reduction, optimised by projections where the named classes are most separated.

```{r guided tour 6D, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# The tour requires making many plots, and updating.
# The RStudio graphics device doesn't work well
# Open a graphics window
# quartz()  # Mac OSX
# X11()     # Windows
animate_xy(flea[,1:6], guided_tour(lda_pp(flea$species)), axes="bottomleft")
```

---
# Manual tour

This is a good way to determine how important a structure in the projection is to a particular variable contribution. You can "rotate" a variable out, and observe if the pattern remains or disappears. 

```{r generate a sequence to rotate a variable out of a projection, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# When you find a low dimensional projection from some other technique
# such as principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis or 
# projection pursuit, it is useful to examine the sensitivity of structure
# to variables in the projection. This is the purpose of the manual tour. 
# Take a variable, and rotate it out of the projection and see if the structure
# persists or disappears.
flea_std <- tourr::rescale(flea[, 1:6])

rb <- basis_random(n = ncol(flea_std))
mtour <- manual_tour(basis = rb, manip_var = 4)
sshow <- array2df(array = mtour, data = flea_std)
render_plotly(slides = sshow)

render_plotly(slides = sshow, col = col_of(flea$species), 
  fps = 2)
```

# Examining models: randomForest

We will take a look at the vote matrix from a random forest fit, on the classic olive oil data. The vote matrix contains the proportion of times each observation is predicted to be in each class. Geometrically it is a simplex. Points close to a vertex, correspond to observations where the classifier almost always predicts to one class, that is, very certain. Points between vertices are observations with uncertainty.

```{r read and tour on in a classic data set, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
olive <- read_csv("http://www.ggobi.org/book/data/olive.csv") %>%
  rename(name=X1)
olive <- olive %>%
  filter(region == 1) %>%
  mutate(area = factor(area))
pal <- brewer.pal(4, "Dark2")
col <- pal[olive$area]
# drop eicosenoic, all low for south
animate_xy(olive[,4:10], axes="bottomleft", col=col) 
# Drop Sicily
animate_xy(olive[olive$area!=4,4:10], axes="bottomleft", col=col[olive$area!=4]) 
```

```{r Fit a randomForest model an examine the vote matrix, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
olive_rf <- randomForest(area~., data=olive[,-c(1, 2, 11)], importance=TRUE, proximity=TRUE)

# Examining models: tsne

This is a preliminary R package, [sneezy](https://github.com/sa-lee/sneezy) for exploring nonlinear dimension reduction solutions, with a tour. It is the work of [Stuart Lee](https://stuartlee.org).

The data is 10D. [t-SNE](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/) is a non-linear dimension reduction algorithm which is used to view cluster structure in high-dimensional data. There is an R package implementation, [Rtsne](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rtsne/index.html). 

It can be particularly hard to tune the parameters when fitting the t-SNE model. This provides a way to map back to the original data space, to see how the data was transformed.

.pull-left[
```{r nonlinear dimension reduction, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# remotes::install_github("sa-lee/sneezy")

library(sneezy)
# Read a benchmark data set
spheres <- subset(multi, key %in% c("A", "D"))
labels <- ifelse(spheres$key == "A", "sub-gaussian", "10-d 2x cluster")
spheres <- as.matrix(spheres[, -c(1,2)])

# t-SNE plot
set.seed(1010010)
coords <- basic_tsne(spheres, perplexity = 30)
pl <- ggplot(as.data.frame(coords$Y), aes(V1, V2)) +

        axis.ticks = element_blank(),

        panel.grid = element_blank())

pl +  add_triangles(coords) 

# in data space, with a triangulation of the points from the tSNE view
# quartz()
# X11()
pal <- c("#1B9E77", "#D95F02")[as.integer(as.factor(labels))]
sneezy_triangles(spheres, coords, col = pal)
```
]
.pull-right[
You can see that in the data space, that the 

- three small clusters are there, are very close and very compact. 
- Next to them is a long, elliptical cluster, that is also small and compact. 
- The two big clusters are spherical and far apart. 

From t-SNE 2D represenation, the 6 clusters are clearly identified. We probably would have missed that there were 6 clusters using the tour alone, because four of them are so close together, and the distance between clusters is heterogeneous. t-SNE destroys the between cluster information, and the relative position of clusters in the high-d space. 

In combination with the tour, we get a deeper understanding of the cluster structure.

# Comparison to parallel coordinates

```{r tour again for comparison, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# quartz()
# X11()
pal <- brewer.pal(4, "Dark2")
col <- pal[olive$area]
# drop eicosenoic, all low for south
animate_xy(olive[,4:10], axes="bottomleft", col=col) 
# Drop Sicily
animate_xy(olive[olive$area!=4,4:10], axes="bottomleft", col=col[olive$area!=4]) 
```

Parallel coordinates show multiple dimensions by drawing lines connectiong observations plotted as univariate dotplots. It is a parallel geometric space rather than a Euclidean space. But is can be useful for getting a single static view, as an alternative to a scatterplot matrix.

```{r make a parallel coordinate plot of the olive data, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggparcoord(olive, columns=4:10, groupColumn=3, order="anyClass") + 
  scale_colour_brewer("", palette="Dark2")
```

---
# Comparison to heatmap

A heatmap uses maps a quantitative variable to colour, and displays in a matrix layout. Often accompanied by a clustering, or ordering of rows and columns. Colour mapping of a quantitative variable is the lowest on the hierarchy of mappings, and difficult for a user to accurately read the information. The coordinate system underlying this form of mapping is not clear, its not Euclidean.

```{r make a heatmap of the olive data, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(superheat)
superheat(olive[,4:10], scale=TRUE, 
          pretty.order.rows=TRUE, pretty.order.cols=TRUE,
          row.dendrogram = TRUE) 
```

# Making a tourr animation using plotly

The easiest approach is to use the `play_tour_path` function from `spinifex`. Either show it like, or save it to an html file for later replay with `save_html` from the `htmltools` package.

```{r plotly tourr, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
flea_std <- rescale(tourr::flea[,1:6])
tpath    <- save_history(flea_std, max = 3)

pg <- play_tour_path(tour_path = tpath, data = flea_std, angle = .15)
pg 
save_html(pg, file="mytour.html")
```

---
# Making a tourr animation using gganimate

The function `render_gif` is available in the development version of the `tourr` package. It will save the tour projections as an animated gif.

```{r saving a tour as an animated fig using gganimate, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(gganimate)
render_gif(flea[,1:6], grand_tour(), display_xy(axes="off"),
           frames=200, 
           gif_file="mytour.gif")
```
